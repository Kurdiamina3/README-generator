### Description
Using Node.js, this application generates a README.md file. This application saves any developer the hassle of formatting a README, and includes all the necessary requirements of one. My project stands out because of its ease and simplicity. I learned through this assignment, while drawing inspiration from other README's what I wanted in my own template. This will be a very useful application for me to use. One challenge I faced was while I was writing out my data, if I made a mistake, I did not how to go back and fix it, unless I go into the generated README to edit it.
